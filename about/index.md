# About tiqr

The ideas behind tiqr were born one Friday afternoon in September 2010. A prototype was developed funded by the SURFnet/Kennisnet Innovation Project and was demonstrated at a show in December 2010. Because of the enthusiasm among the visitors to this event, we decided to further develop tiqr and to release it in open source. tiqr is intended as a plug-in authentication method to be used in federated and non-federated web applications. It comes with absolutely no warranty or support and we are still working very hard on it. Nevertheless, it will work most of the time and we encourage you to try it and send us feedback!

tiqr was invented at SURFnet and was built with help from Egeniq and Stroomt, you can find some more information about these organisations below.
